# Simple Shoes Shopping App

This is a simple Shoes Shopping App.

This application is not exactly for completely beginner programmers; advanced logic and state management tools have been implemented in this application.

But, since the codebase is completely documented in simple English, beginnner programmers can easily go through the codes, understand it, and try to built this application on thier own.

## Key Points about this application
This application is mostly an UI application, since, it is not connected to any database or APIs or any other back-end functionality.

The data used in this application is entirely dummy data that is hard-coded in a specific file in this project directory. This data must not be considered as a real world data.

Although the data used in this application is hard-coded, the logic of this application is built in such a way that this application will work fine if real-world data is provided to it.

This application is also built responsive for running it seamlessly on desktop/ laptop screen as well as on Android.

State management has also been implemented in this application using [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package.

**This application is entirely built using the _Dart Programming Language_ in _Flutter framework_.**
